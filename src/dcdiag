Directory Server Diagnosis

Performing initial setup:
   Trying to find home server...
   * Verifying that the local machine dc01, is a Directory Server.
   Home Server = dc01
   * Connecting to directory service on server dc01.
   * Identified AD Forest.
   Collecting AD specific global data
   * Collecting site info.
   Calling ldap_search_init_page(hld,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=laantillana,DC=local,LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE,(objectCategory=ntDSSiteSettings),.......
   The previous call succeeded
   Iterating through the sites
   Looking at base site object: CN=NTDS Site Settings,CN=Antillana-std,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=laantillana,DC=local
   Getting ISTG and options for the site
   * Identifying all servers.
   Calling ldap_search_init_page(hld,CN=Sites,CN=Configuration,DC=laantillana,DC=local,LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE,(objectClass=ntDSDsa),.......
   The previous call succeeded....

Doing initial required tests

   Testing server: Antillana-std\DC01
      Starting test: Connectivity
         * Active Directory LDAP Services Check
         Determining IP4 connectivity
         * Active Directory RPC Services Check
         ......................... DC01 passed test Connectivity

Doing primary tests

   Testing server: Antillana-std\DC01
      Starting test: Advertising
         The DC DC01 is advertising itself as a DC and having a DS.
         The DC DC01 is advertising as an LDAP server
         The DC DC01 is advertising as having a writeable directory
         The DC DC01 is advertising as a Key Distribution Center
         The DC DC01 is advertising as a time server
         The DS DC01 is advertising as a GC.
         ......................... DC01 passed test Advertising
      Test omitted by user request: CheckSecurityError
      Test omitted by user request: CutoffServers
      Starting test: FrsEvent
         * The File Replication Service Event log test
         Skip the test because the server is running DFSR.

The replicated folder will remain in the initial synchronization state until it has replicated with its partner dc02.laantillana.local. If the server was in the process of being promoted to a domain controller, the domain controller will not advertise and function as a domain controller until this issue is resolved.
